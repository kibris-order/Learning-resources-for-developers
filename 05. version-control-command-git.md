## Basic git commands:
### 1. Installing Git:

If you haven't installed Git, you can download and install it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

### 2. Configuring Git:

```bash
# Set your name and email
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### 3. Initializing a Repository:

```bash
# Create a new directory
mkdir my_project

# Navigate into the directory
cd my_project

# Initialize a Git repository
git init
```

### 4. Creating and Committing Changes:

```bash
# Create a new file
touch README.md

# Open the file in a text editor and add some content

# Stage changes
git add README.md

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### 5. Checking Status and History:

```bash
# Check the status of your repository
git status

# View the commit history
git log
```

### 6. Branching and Merging:

```bash
# Create a new branch
git branch feature_branch

# Switch to the new branch
git checkout feature_branch  # or use "git switch feature_branch" (Git 2.23 and later)

# Make changes and commit

# Switch back to the main branch
git checkout main  # or use "git switch main"

# Merge the feature branch into the main branch
git merge feature_branch
```

### 7. Working with Remotes:

```bash
# Add a remote repository (GitHub in this case)
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my_project.git

# Push changes to the remote repository
git push -u origin main
```

### 8. Cloning a Repository:

```bash
# Clone a repository from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

# Navigate into the cloned repository
cd repository
```

### 9. Pulling Changes:

```bash
# Pull changes from the remote repository
git pull origin main
```

### 10. Resolving Conflicts:

If there are conflicts during a merge or pull, Git will mark the conflicting files. Manually resolve the conflicts in the files and then:

```bash
# Add the resolved files
git add <conflicted-file>

# Continue with the merge or pull process
git merge --continue  # or "git commit" after resolving conflicts
```

## Working with branches
### 1. Creating a New Branch:

To create a new branch, use the following commands:

```bash
# Create a new branch
git branch new_feature_branch
```

### 2. Switching Between Branches:

Switching between branches can be done using the `git checkout` command (prior to Git 2.23) or `git switch` command (Git 2.23 and later):

```bash
# Switch to an existing branch
git checkout existing_branch  # or use "git switch existing_branch"

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b new_branch  # or use "git switch -c new_branch"
```

### 3. Listing Branches:

To view a list of branches in your repository:

```bash
# List all branches
git branch
```

The current branch is indicated with an asterisk (`*`).

### 4. Deleting Branches:

```bash
# Delete a local branch
git branch -d branch_to_delete

# Force delete a branch (use with caution)
git branch -D branch_to_delete
```

### 5. Renaming Branches:

```bash
# Rename the current branch
git branch -m new_branch_name
```

### 6. Merging Branches:

```bash
# Switch to the branch you want to merge into
git checkout target_branch  # or use "git switch target_branch"

# Merge a branch into the current branch
git merge source_branch
```

### 7. Viewing Branch History:

```bash
# View the commit history of a specific branch
git log branch_name
```

### 8. Pushing a New Branch to Remote:

```bash
# Push a new local branch to the remote repository
git push -u origin new_branch
```

### 9. Pulling Changes from Remote Branch:

```bash
# Pull changes from a remote branch
git pull origin remote_branch
```

### 10. Tracking Remote Branches:

```bash
# Track a remote branch
git checkout --track origin/remote_branch  # or use "git switch --track origin/remote_branch"
```

These commands cover the basics of branch management in Git. Remember to replace branch names with your actual branch names, and adapt commands based on your specific needs. For more details, refer to the [official Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc).
