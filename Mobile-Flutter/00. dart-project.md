Here's a table with the top 10 commonly used **Dart CLI commands** and their uses:

| **Dart CLI Command**   | **Use/Description**                                                                                  |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `dart create <project>`| Creates a new Dart project. Use it to scaffold a new application with basic structure and files.      |
| `dart run <file>`      | Runs a Dart file or package. Executes the specified Dart program (e.g., `dart run main.dart`).        |
| `dart test`            | Runs unit tests in a Dart project. It executes all the test files inside the `test/` directory.       |
| `dart pub get`         | Fetches and installs the dependencies listed in the `pubspec.yaml` file.                             |
| `dart pub upgrade`     | Upgrades the dependencies in the `pubspec.yaml` file to the latest compatible versions.               |
| `dart format <file>`   | Formats Dart source code according to the official Dart style guide.                                 |
| `dart analyze`         | Analyzes the project's code for potential issues like errors or unused variables.                     |
| `dart compile exe <file>` | Compiles a Dart program to a native executable. Generates a `.exe` file (or equivalent on Linux/Mac). |
| `dart migrate`         | Assists in migrating your project to use **null safety** features, showing suggestions and changes.    |
| `dart doc`             | Generates API documentation for your project based on your Dart code.                                |

These commands are essential for managing Dart projects, including running, testing, analyzing, and formatting code, as well as handling dependencies.



Creating and running a Dart project is a straightforward process. You can do it using the Dart SDK and command-line interface (CLI). Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Install Dart SDK
First, ensure that you have the Dart SDK installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Dart website](https://dart.dev/get-dart).


### Step 2: Verify Dart Installation
After installing, verify that Dart is installed correctly by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```bash
dart --version
```
You should see the installed version of Dart.

### Step 3: Create a New Dart Project
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
3. Run the following command to create a new Dart project:
   ```bash
   dart create my_dart_project
   ```
   Replace `my_dart_project` with your desired project name.

### Step 4: Navigate to Your Project Directory
```bash
cd my_dart_project
```

### Step 5: Examine the Project Structure
The created project will have the following structure:
```
my_dart_project/
├── bin/
│   └── my_dart_project.dart
├── test/
│   └── my_dart_project_test.dart
├── pubspec.yaml
└── README.md
```
- **`bin/my_dart_project.dart`**: This is the main entry point of your Dart application.
- **`test/`**: This directory is for unit tests.
- **`pubspec.yaml`**: This file contains metadata about your project, including dependencies.

### Step 6: Write Your Dart Code
Open `bin/my_dart_project.dart` in your favorite text editor and write some Dart code. For example:
```dart
void main() {
  print('Hello, Dart!');
}
```

### Step 7: Run Your Dart Project
To run your Dart project, execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
dart run
```
You should see the output:
```
Hello, Dart!
```

### Step 8: Add Dependencies (Optional)
If you want to add external packages (dependencies) to your project, you can do so by modifying the `pubspec.yaml` file. For example, to add the `http` package, you would update your `pubspec.yaml` like this:
```yaml
dependencies:
  http: ^0.13.4
```
After adding dependencies, run:
```bash
dart pub get
```
This command fetches the dependencies listed in the `pubspec.yaml`.

### Step 9: Testing Your Code
You can also create tests in the `test/` directory and run them using:
```bash
dart test
```

### Summary
1. Install the Dart SDK.
2. Create a new Dart project with `dart create`.
3. Write your code in `bin/my_dart_project.dart`.
4. Run the project using `dart run`.
5. Optionally, manage dependencies in `pubspec.yaml`.

This process gives you a solid foundation for developing and running Dart applications. Happy coding!
