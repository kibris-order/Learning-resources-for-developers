Flutter navigation is typically handled by using the `Navigator` class, which manages the app's stack of pages (routes). You can push new pages onto the stack or pop them off to navigate between different screens.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use **Flutter navigation** with two screens:

### Example: Navigating between two screens

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// Main entry point of the app.
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Root of the application, defining a home screen.
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Navigation Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: FirstScreen(), // The first screen is loaded initially.
    );
  }
}

// The first screen widget.
class FirstScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('First Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          // When the button is pressed, navigate to the second screen.
          onPressed: () {
            Navigator.push(
              context,
              MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen()),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Go to Second Screen'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The second screen widget.
class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Second Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          // When the button is pressed, go back to the first screen.
          onPressed: () {
            Navigator.pop(context);
          },
          child: Text('Go Back to First Screen'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### How this works:
1. **`Navigator.push`**: This method pushes a new route (or screen) onto the navigation stack. When the button on the first screen is pressed, it navigates to the second screen.
2. **`Navigator.pop`**: This method pops the current route off the stack, returning to the previous screen (in this case, going back to the first screen).
3. **`MaterialPageRoute`**: This is used to define a route (or screen) to navigate to. In this example, it creates a route that transitions to `SecondScreen`.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Navigation** in Flutter is based on the **stack** of routes (pages).
- You **push** new routes to go forward to another page and **pop** them to go back to the previous page.
  
This basic example demonstrates one of the simplest navigation patterns in Flutter, but you can also implement more complex navigations such as named routes, drawer-based navigation, or tab-based navigation.
