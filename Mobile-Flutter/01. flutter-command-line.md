Here’s a table with the **top 10 Flutter CLI commands** and their uses:

| **Flutter CLI Command**     | **Use/Description**                                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `flutter create <project>`  | Creates a new Flutter project. Scaffolds the necessary files and directories to start building a Flutter app.         |
| `flutter run`               | Runs the Flutter app on a connected device or emulator. You can specify a device with `-d` (e.g., `flutter run -d <device_id>`). |
| `flutter doctor`            | Checks your system for required dependencies to run Flutter and reports any missing components or issues.              |
| `flutter build <target>`    | Builds the Flutter app for a specific platform (e.g., APK, iOS, web). Example: `flutter build apk` or `flutter build ios`. |
| `flutter pub get`           | Fetches and installs the dependencies listed in the `pubspec.yaml` file. Similar to Dart’s `pub get`.                 |
| `flutter pub upgrade`       | Upgrades the dependencies in `pubspec.yaml` to their latest compatible versions.                                      |
| `flutter clean`             | Cleans the build directory. Useful when you want to do a fresh build by removing old build files.                      |
| `flutter test`              | Runs the unit tests for the project. Executes all the tests in the `test/` directory.                                  |
| `flutter analyze`           | Analyzes the code for potential issues and provides warnings or errors for best practices and code issues.             |
| `flutter install`           | Installs the Flutter app on a connected device without running it.                                                     |

These **Flutter CLI commands** are essential for managing Flutter apps, from creation and building to testing, analyzing, and deploying.
