Here's an example of a **stateful widget** in Flutter, followed by the key differences between a **stateless** and **stateful** widget.

### Example of a Stateful Widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// This is the main function, the entry point of the app.
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp is a StatefulWidget because it manages a state that can change.
class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyAppState createState() => _MyAppState();
}

// The _MyAppState class holds the mutable state for MyApp.
class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  // This is the mutable state that will change (the counter).
  int _counter = 0;

  // Method to increment the counter when the button is pressed.
  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++; // Update the state and re-render the UI with the new value.
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Stateful Widget Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Stateful Widget Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'You have pressed the button this many times:',
              ),
              Text(
                '$_counter', // Displays the current value of the counter.
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 40),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: _incrementCounter, // Calls the method when the button is pressed.
          tooltip: 'Increment',
          child: Icon(Icons.add),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Key Differences between **StatelessWidget** and **StatefulWidget**:

| **Aspect**               | **StatelessWidget**                                    | **StatefulWidget**                                  |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **State Management**      | Cannot hold state. UI is immutable after it's built.  | Can hold mutable state that can change over time.  |
| **Rebuild**               | Only rebuilds when external parameters change.         | Rebuilds whenever internal state changes using `setState()`. |
| **Use Case**              | Best for static content that doesnâ€™t change, like static text or fixed UI components. | Best for dynamic content where UI changes based on user interaction (e.g., buttons, form inputs, etc.). |
| **Performance**           | Lightweight and better for performance.                | Slightly heavier due to state management.          |
| **Example**               | Showing static text or images.                         | Counter app where button presses change displayed value. |

In the **stateful widget** example above, the app shows a button and a counter that increments each time the button is pressed. This is a typical use case where the state (the counter value) changes over time, necessitating the use of a **stateful widget**.
