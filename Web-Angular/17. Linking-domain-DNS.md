There are multiple ways of hosing a site, The following are the ways

- Get a hosting provider and then buy domain + hosting at the same time
  - Issues with this approach is you are forced to use the same company and you will possibly be overcharged
- Buy domain separately, Buy hosting separately, then link them
  - This approach is the most resonable approach but not each one
  - Some services like firebase provide free hosting for frontend applications, they support pure html/css, angular, react etc
  - If you want to link your domain to those services you need to use the 2nd approach.
  - To use the second approach, you need to purchase only domain, the link with firebase hosting.
  - To do the liking you need to understand some DNS terms
  - The following are the DNS terms you need to understand, and everything will be easy from then on.


When setting up a domain, understanding **A**, **AAA** (also known as **AAAA**), and other DNS (Domain Name System) records is essential for properly configuring your domain to route traffic to the correct server or service. Here's an overview:


### 1. **A Record (Address Record)**:
- The **A record** maps a domain name to an **IPv4 address** (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
- When someone enters your domain in their browser, the A record tells the DNS which IPv4 address to direct them to.
- Example:
  ```
  example.com -> 192.168.1.1
  ```

### 2. **AAAA Record (Quad A Record)**:
- The **AAAA record** is similar to the A record but maps the domain name to an **IPv6 address** instead of an IPv4 address.
- IPv6 addresses are longer and more complex than IPv4, designed to accommodate the growing number of devices online.
- Example:
  ```
  example.com -> 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
  ```

### 3. **CNAME Record (Canonical Name Record)**:
- A **CNAME record** maps a domain or subdomain to another domain name rather than an IP address.
- Itâ€™s used when you want multiple domains to point to the same server without having to update IP addresses in multiple places.
- Example:
  ```
  www.example.com -> example.com
  ```

### 4. **MX Record (Mail Exchange Record)**:
- The **MX record** tells the DNS where to route emails sent to your domain.
- It specifies the mail server responsible for receiving emails and its priority.
- Example:
  ```
  example.com -> mailserver.example.com (priority 10)
  ```

### 5. **TXT Record (Text Record)**:
- A **TXT record** holds text information for various purposes, like domain verification or email security settings (e.g., SPF, DKIM).
- Example:
  ```
  v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all
  ```

### 6. **NS Record (Name Server Record)**:
- **NS records** specify the authoritative name servers for your domain. These servers hold the actual DNS records.
- Example:
  ```
  example.com -> ns1.example-dns.com, ns2.example-dns.com
  ```

### 7. **SRV Record (Service Record)**:
- **SRV records** define the location (hostname and port) of services such as SIP, XMPP, or LDAP.
- Example:
  ```
  _sip._tcp.example.com -> sipserver.example.com:5060
  ```

### 8. **PTR Record (Pointer Record)**:
- A **PTR record** is used for reverse DNS lookups, mapping an IP address back to a domain name.
- Example:
  ```
  1.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa -> example.com
  ```

### Summary of Use Cases:
- **A Record**: Points to an IPv4 address.
- **AAAA Record**: Points to an IPv6 address.
- **CNAME Record**: Aliases one domain to another.
- **MX Record**: Directs email traffic.
- **TXT Record**: Provides additional information for security or verification.
- **NS Record**: Specifies the name servers.
- **SRV Record**: Directs specific services (e.g., VoIP).
- **PTR Record**: Used for reverse DNS lookups.

These records work together to ensure your domain functions correctly, whether you're hosting a website, email service, or other applications.
