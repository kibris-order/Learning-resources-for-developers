### Angular Component Lifecycle:

In Angular, components go through a lifecycle during their creation, rendering, and destruction. Understanding the
component lifecycle is crucial for managing various aspects of your application, such as initialization, data binding,
and cleanup. Here's an overview of the main lifecycle hooks in Angular:

1. **ngOnChanges:**
    - Triggered when an input property of the component changes.
    - Receives a `SimpleChanges` object containing the previous and current values of the input properties.

2. **ngOnInit:**
    - Invoked once, after the component is initialized.
    - Used for initialization logic, like fetching data or setting up subscriptions.
    - This is a good place to perform tasks that are required after the component has been instantiated.

3. **ngDoCheck:**
    - Called during every change detection run.
    - Allows you to implement your own custom change detection mechanism.
    - Use with caution, as it can impact performance.

4. **ngAfterContentInit:**
    - Called after the component's content (e.g., projected content) has been initialized.
    - It's a good place to perform initialization that relies on the content.

5. **ngAfterContentChecked:**
    - Called after every check of the component's content.
    - Useful for tasks that need to be performed after every check of the projected content.

6. **ngAfterViewInit:**
    - Invoked after the component's view has been initialized.
    - Use it for initializing third-party libraries or performing operations after the view is ready.

7. **ngAfterViewChecked:**
    - Called after every check of the component's view.
    - Similar to `ngAfterContentChecked` but for the view.

8. **ngOnDestroy:**
    - Invoked just before the component is destroyed.
    - Cleanup tasks, such as unsubscribing from observables or detaching event handlers, should be performed here.

Here's a basic sequence of the lifecycle hooks:

1. `ngOnChanges` (if there are input property changes)
2. `ngOnInit`
3. `ngDoCheck`
4. `ngAfterContentInit`
5. `ngAfterContentChecked`
6. `ngAfterViewInit`
7. `ngAfterViewChecked`
8. `ngOnDestroy`

Understanding and leveraging these hooks appropriately can help you manage the lifecycle of your Angular components
efficiently.

### Angular Component Lifecycle Example:

Assume we have a component called `ExampleComponent`. The proper way to use each lifecycle method is to implement its
interface, so for ngOnInit, we implement OnInit in the component:

```typescript
import {
    Component, Input, OnChanges, OnInit, DoCheck, AfterContentInit,
    AfterContentChecked, AfterViewInit, AfterViewChecked, OnDestroy
} from '@angular/core';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-example',
    template: '<p>{{ message }}</p>',
})
export class ExampleComponent implements OnChanges, OnInit, DoCheck,
    AfterContentInit, AfterContentChecked,
    AfterViewInit, AfterViewChecked, OnDestroy {
    @Input() inputMessage: string = 'Default Message';
    message: string = '';

    constructor() {
        console.log('Constructor');
    }

    ngOnChanges() {
        console.log('ngOnChanges');
        // You can perform logic based on input property changes here
        this.message = this.inputMessage.toUpperCase();
    }

    ngOnInit() {
        console.log('ngOnInit');
        // Initialization logic here
    }

    ngDoCheck() {
        console.log('ngDoCheck');
        // Custom change detection logic
    }

    ngAfterContentInit() {
        console.log('ngAfterContentInit');
        // Initialization logic that relies on content
    }

    ngAfterContentChecked() {
        console.log('ngAfterContentChecked');
        // Logic to be executed after every check of content
    }

    ngAfterViewInit() {
        console.log('ngAfterViewInit');
        // Initialization logic after the view has been initialized
    }

    ngAfterViewChecked() {
        console.log('ngAfterViewChecked');
        // Logic to be executed after every check of the view
    }

    ngOnDestroy() {
        console.log('ngOnDestroy');
        // Cleanup logic, e.g., unsubscribe from subscriptions
    }
}
```

This component includes all the mentioned lifecycle hooks with minimal logic for demonstration purposes. You can then
use this component in another Angular component or template:

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<app-example [inputMessage]="'Hello Lifecycle Hooks'"></app-example>
```

As the component goes through its lifecycle, the corresponding hooks will be called, and you'll see the console logs in
the developer tools. Adjust the logic within each hook based on your specific requirements.
